			<p>
				My name is Alondra Angel and I'm currently a graduate student working towards my master's degree in Instructional Design and Educational Technology from the Department of Education at the University of Utah. Currently working Part-time at a 3D Steel Design Company. 
                
                Apart from school and work I love spending time with my family. I love trying new things. In my spare time you can find me baking, watching my favorite TV show:Friends, or create new digital prints.  â€‹
